# Project Proposal

Problem:

Our goal is to determine if there is evidence to suggest racial bias in fatal shootings by police. Given factors such as situational characteristics (eg. armed, signs of mental illness, manner of death, etc.) and regional characteristics (eg. poverty rate, share of white population, median income, etc.), are we able to predict the victim's race? 


Dataset:

Data is sourced from an organization named Mapping Police Violence, which in turn sourced from the three largest, most comprehensive and impartial crowdsourced databases on police killings: FatalEncounters.org, the US Police Shootings Database, and KilledbyPolice.net. The data contains shootings from 2013-2020. Variables include victim's age, victim's gender, victim's race, date of incident, and location specifics. 

Additional census data on poverty rate, high school graduation rate, median household income, regional racial demographics, and regional political leaning will also be merged to the main dataset for more comprehensive analysis. Additional police budget, employment, and policies data will also be merged for variables such as requires de-escalation, bans chokeholds, total city revenue, etc.


Value: 

Racially motivated and fatal shootings by police officers sparked widespread public attention and resulted in major activism across the nation the past decade, and especially in the last few months of 2020. Given our data, if our modeling indicates high predictive accuracy, this suggests the predictors are significant in determining a shooting victim's race. Low predictive accuracy would suggest little to no racial bias. 

This project is worthwhile because of its relevancy and societal significance. The project is likely to be successful given the incorporation of various datasets for a comprehensive analysis.
