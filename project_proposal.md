# Project Proposal

Introduction:

Racially motivated and fatal shootings by police officers sparked widespread public attention and resulted in major activism across the nation in the past decade, and especially in the last few months of 2020, as these were not isolated events. Demonstrations and protests prevailed earlier this year against police brutality and racially motivated civilian-officer interactions. Nearly 11,000 demonstration, political violence, and strategic development events were recorded across America since late May, according to new US Crisis Monitor data gathered by ACLED (The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project). Nearly 73% of all demonstrations from late May to late August, across 2,440 locations in all 50 states and DC, were associated with the BLM movement.

Problem:

Our goal is to understand what factors most influence civilian and police interaction outcomes and determine if there is evidence to suggest racial bias. Given demographic and situational factors, are we able to predict outcomes for these interactions?


Data:

Our dataset is sourced from Open Minneapolis. The data contains police involved incidents from 2016-2020 with one dataset focused primarily on police stops (https://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets/police-stop-data/) and the other on police violence (http://opendata.minneapolismn.gov/datasets/police-use-of-force). From these datasets, we want to use variables like victim's age, victim's gender, victim's race, date of incident, precinct, neighborhood, etc. to determine the likelihood of receiving a citation if stopped by the police, or which type of police force would be experienced in more severe situations. All data is on Minneapolis specifically. 


Value: 

By examining the city involved in the incident that reignited the BLM movement nationally, this project is worthwhile given its relevancy and societal significance since Minneapolis was the location of the killing of George Floyd in late May 2020. The project is likely to be successful given the detailed view into a specific region with tens of thousands of incidents to model from. We also have comprehensive data over time, so trends in bias could also be explored to provide insight into the factors that led up to the incident earlier this year.
