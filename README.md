Project Name: Racial Bias in Fatal Police Shootings

Project Members: 

Elina Hvirtsman <eh582@cornell.edu>

Lucy Du <dd483@cornell.edu>


Project Description:

Our goal is to determine if there is evidence to suggest racial bias in fatal shootings by police. Given factors such as situational characteristics (eg. armed, signs of mental illness, manner of death, etc.) and regional characteristics (eg. poverty rate, share of white population, median income, etc.), are we able to predict the victim's race?
