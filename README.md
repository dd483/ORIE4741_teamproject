Project Name: Racial Bias in Civilian-Officer Outcomes
Project Members: 

Elina Hvirtsman <eh582@cornell.edu>

Julia Ng <jen67@cornell.edu>

Lucy Du <dd483@cornell.edu>


Project Description:

Racially motivated and fatal shootings by police officers sparked widespread public attention and resulted in major activism across the nation in the past decade, and especially in the last few months of 2020. Our goal is to understand what factors most influence civilian and police interaction outcomes and determine if there is evidence to suggest racial bias. Given demographic and situational factors, are we able to predict outcomes for these interactions?
