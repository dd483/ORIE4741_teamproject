Project Description:

Our projectâ€™s goal is to understand what factors most influence civilian and police interaction outcomes and determine if conduct by the Minneapolis police precincts can be predicted. Given demographic and situational factors, we fit and develop models that predict whether the civilian will be issued a citation in the event of being stopped by police, or which police force the civilian will experience in more severe situations.
